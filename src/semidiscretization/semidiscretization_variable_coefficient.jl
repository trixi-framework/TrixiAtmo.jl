`aux_field` is an optional function taking a coordinate vector `x` and the current
`equations` as arguments. It is used to fill an additional field `aux_vars` in the `cache`,
which will be available, e.g., in flux computations. The current `equations` need to set
`have_aux_node_vars` to `True()` and `n_aux_node_vars` to the number of auxiliary variables
per node.
