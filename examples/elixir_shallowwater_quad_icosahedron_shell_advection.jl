# To run a convergence test, we have two options:
# 1. Use the p4est variable initial_refinement_level to refine the grid:
#    - To do this, line 46 ("initial_refinement_level = 0") must NOT be a comment
#    - Call convergence_test("../examples/elixir_shallowwater_quad_icosahedron_shell_advection.jl", 4, initial_refinement_level = 0)
#    - NOT OPTIMAL: Good convergence the first iterations, but then it stagnates. Reason: The geometry does not improve with refinement.
# 2. Use the variable trees_per_face_dimension of P4estMeshQuadIcosahedron2D
#    - To do this, line 46 ("initial_refinement_level = 0") MUST BE commented/removed
#    - Call convergence_test("../examples/elixir_shallowwater_quad_icosahedron_shell_advection.jl", 4, cells_per_dimension = (1,1))
#    - OPTIMAL convergence of polydeg + 1. Reason: The geometry improves with refinement.
