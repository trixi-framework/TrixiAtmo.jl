Abstract type used to dispatch on systems of equations in covariant form, in which fluxes
and prognostic variables are stored and computed in terms of their contravariant components 
defining their expansions in terms of the local covariant tangent basis. The type parameter
`NDIMS` denotes the dimension of the manifold on which the equations are solved, while
`NDIMS_AMBIENT` is the dimension of the ambient space in which such a manifold is embedded.

When using this equation type, functions which are evaluated pointwise, such as fluxes, 
source terms, and initial conditions take in the extra argument `aux_vars`, which contains 
the geometric information needed for the covariant form. The type parameter 
`GlobalCoordinateSystem` specifies the global coordinate system used to define the 
covariant tangent basis, and may be either [`GlobalCartesianCoordinates`](@ref) or 
[`GlobalSphericalCoordinates`](@ref). The `GlobalCoordinateSystem` type parameter also 
specifies the coordinate system with respect to which the initial condition should be 
prescribed.

    transform_initial_condition(initial_condition, equations)

Takes in a function with the signature `initial_condition(x, t, equations)` which returns 
an initial condition given in terms of global Cartesian or zonal/meridional velocity
components, and returns another function `initial_condition_transformed(x, t, equations)` 
or `initial_condition_transformed(x, t, aux_vars, equations)` which returns the same 
initial data, but transformed to the appropriate prognostic variables used internally by 
the solver. For the covariant form, this involves a transformation of the global velocity 
components to contravariant components using [`global2contravariant`](@ref) as well as a 
conversion from primitive to conservative variables. For standard Cartesian formulations, 
this simply involves a conversion from  primitive to conservative variables. The intention 
here is to have a set of test cases (for example, [`initial_condition_gaussian`](@ref)) for 
which the initial condition is prescribed using a standardized set of primitive variables 
in a global Cartesian coordinates, and transformed to the specific prognostic variables 
required for a given model.
!!! note 
    When using the covariant formulation, the initial velocity components should be defined 
    in the coordinate system specified by the `GlobalCoordinateSystem` type parameter in
    [`AbstractCovariantEquations`](@ref).
