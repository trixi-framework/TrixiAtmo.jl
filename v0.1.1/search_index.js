The gravitational acceleration is denoted by g.\n\nThe 3D Shallow Water Equations (SWE) extend the 2D SWE to model shallow water flows on 2D manifolds embedded within 3D space.  To confine the flow to the 2D manifold, a source term incorporating a Lagrange multiplier is applied to the momentum equations using the function source_terms_lagrange_multiplier.  This term effectively removes momentum components that are normal to the manifold, ensuring the flow remains  constrained within the 2D surface.\n\nTo incorporate the effect of the rotation of the manifold, use the function source_terms_coriolis, which adds the necessary Coriolis source terms to the momentum equations assuming a rotation around the z axis with a rotation rate in radians per time unit given by rotation_rate. To incorporate both Coriolis forces and the Lagrange multiplier terms, use source_terms_coriolis_lagrange_multiplier.\n\nThe additional quantity H_0 is also available to store a reference value for the total water height that is useful to set initial conditions or test the \"lake-at-rest\" well-balancedness.\n\nIn addition to the unknowns, TrixiAtmo.jl currently stores the bottom topography values at the approximation points despite being fixed in time. This is done for convenience of computing the bottom topography gradients on the fly during the approximation as well as computing auxiliary quantities like the total water height H or the entropy variables. This affects the implementation and use of these equations in various ways:\n\nThe flux values corresponding to the bottom topography must be zero.\nThe bottom topography values must be included when defining initial conditions, boundary conditions or source terms.\nAnalysisCallback analyzes this variable.\nTrixi.jl's visualization tools will visualize the bottom topography by default.\n\nReferences:\n\nJ.
